# ðŸ§¬ Central Dogma Interactive

A comprehensive educational simulation that visualizes the complete central dogma of molecular biology: DNA â†’ RNA â†’ Protein and its reverse. This interactive tool provides animated, step-by-step visualization of transcription, translation, and reverse translation processes.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Dual Animation Modes**: Forward Translation (DNA â†’ mRNA â†’ Protein) and Reverse Translation from protein sequences back to DNA
- **Comprehensive Tooltips**: Hover over elements to learn about nucleotides, amino acids, and cellular components
- **Complete Genetic Code**: Supports all 64 codons and 20 amino acids, and multiple strategies for reverse translation

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Forward Translation (DNA â†’ RNA â†’ Protein)
1. Open `src/index.html` in your web browser
2. Enter a DNA sequence (e.g., `ATGGCCCAGTGA`)
3. Choose "Start Central Dogma" for full DNAâ†’mRNAâ†’Protein animation
4. Hover over any element for detailed educational information

### Reverse Translation (Protein â†’ RNA â†’ DNA)
1. Navigate to `src/reverse-translation.html`
2. Enter a protein sequence using single-letter codes (e.g., `MAQV`)
3. Select an optimization strategy (most common, GC-rich, etc.)
4. Click "Start Reverse Engineering" to see the reverse engineering process
5. Explore the resulting mRNA and DNA sequences with interactive tooltips

## ðŸŽ¯ Educational Applications

### **Perfect for:**
- High school biology classes
- College molecular biology courses
- Self-directed learning about protein synthesis
