# ðŸ§¬ Central Dogma Interactive

An interactive educational simulation that visualizes protein translation from mRNA sequences. Students can explore how ribosomes read genetic code and synthesize proteins through animated, step-by-step visualization.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Interactive Animation**: Watch ribosomes translate mRNA codons into amino acids
- **Educational Tooltips**: Hover over elements to learn about nucleotides, amino acids, and cellular components
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Automatically adapts to different sequence lengths
- **Complete Genetic Code**: Supports all 64 codons and 20 amino acids
- **Cell Context**: Visualizes translation within a cellular environment

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. Open `src/index.html` in your web browser
2. Enter an mRNA sequence (e.g., `AUGGCCCAGUGA`)
3. Click "Start Translation" to watch the animation
4. Hover over elements to see educational information

## ðŸŽ¯ Educational Use

Perfect for:
- High school biology classes
- College molecular biology courses  
- Self-directed learning about protein synthesis
- Understanding the genetic code
